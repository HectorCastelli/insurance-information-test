# Insurance Information Test API

A sample/test application that manages insurance information (mock data).

This API was developer as a showcase of my skills, so it is not ready for real-world usage.

If you wish to follow my decisions during the development process, see the [DevLog](DevLog.md).

## Using the API

If you wish to use this API as an end-user, please read the [documentation](API.md).

## Launch the API

To start the API use the command:

`npm run launch`

You should see the following output on your terminal:

```bash
> insurance-information-test@0.0.1 launch /home/hector/Projects/insurance-information-test
> node ./src/api.js

Insurance Information listening at http://localhost:3000
```

## Testing

To run the Unit and Integration tests use the command:

`npm run test`

## Generate Developer's Documentation

To start the API use the command:

`npm run dev-docs`

The documentation will be generated under the `docs` folder.
